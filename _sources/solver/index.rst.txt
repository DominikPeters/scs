Cones
-----
The cone K can be any Cartesian product of the following primitive cones.
**Note**:The rows of the data matrix :code:`A` correspond to the cones in :code:`K`. The rows of
:code:`A` must be in the order of the cones given above, i.e., first come the rows that
correspond to the zero/free cones, then those that correspond to the positive
orthants, then SOCs, etc.

Semidefinite cone
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

SCS assumes that the matrix variables and the input data corresponding to
semidefinite cones have been vectorized by scaling the off-diagonal entries by
:math:`\sqrt{2}` and stacking the lower triangular elements column-wise. For a :math:`k \times k`
matrix variable (or data matrix) this operation would create a vector of length
:math:`k(k+1)/2`. Scaling by :math:`\sqrt{2}` is required to preserve the inner-product.

To recover the matrix solution this operation must be inverted on the components
of the vector returned by SCS corresponding to semidefinite cones. That is, the
off-diagonal entries must be scaled by :math:`1/\sqrt{2}` and the upper triangular
entries are filled in by copying the values of lower triangular entries.

More explicitly, we want to express :math:`Tr(C X)` as :math:`\text{vec}(C)^\top \text{vec}(X)`,
where the :math:`\text{vec}` operation takes the :math:`k \times k` matrix

.. math::

  X =  \begin{bmatrix}
          X_{11} & X_{12} & \ldots & X_{1k}  \\
          X_{21} & X_{22} & \ldots & X_{2k}  \\
          \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots  \\
          X_{k1} & X_{k2} & \ldots & X_{kk}  \\
        \end{bmatrix}

and produces a vector consisting of the lower triangular elements scaled and arranged as

.. math::

  \text{vec}(X) = (X_{11}, \sqrt{2} X_{21}, ..., \sqrt{2} X_{k1}, X_{22}, \sqrt{2}X_{32}, ..., \sqrt{2}X_{k(k-1)}, X_{kk}).
