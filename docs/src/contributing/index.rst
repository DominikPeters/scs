Contributing
===============
There are many ways you can contribute to SCS, and we welcome all help!
Here are some ideas (of varying difficulty):

* Answer an open `GitHub issue <https://github.com/cvxgrp/scs/issues>`_ 
* Improve the documentation (the website or in the code)
* Add more examples to the docs
* Improve the test coverage
* Improve the Anderson acceleration stability
* Improve the data equilibration 
* Improve the heuristic re-scaling
* Determine how to select the :code:`TAU_FACTOR` term
* Implement a GPU direct linear system solver 
* Add other new linear system solvers
* Add interfaces for other languages (or fix issues in the current interfaces)

If you are interested in helping out, please start by opening a `GitHub issue
<https://github.com/cvxgrp/scs/issues>`_ so we can track progress and ensure
that our priorities align.
